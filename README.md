# Deep Learning for Woven Composite Defects Detection

This project focuses on using deep learning models, specifically 3D U-Nets and convolutional LSTM networks, for the detection of defects in woven composite materials. It includes scripts for training and evaluating the model, preprocessing datasets, and visualizing results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:


## Usage

The project consists of several scripts, each serving a specific purpose in the machine learning pipeline:

### Training the Model (`train.py`)

Train the deep learning model using the specified dataset.


### Testing the Model (`test.py`)

Evaluate the trained model's performance on a test dataset.


### Visualization (`visualization.py`)

Visualize the training process, results, or dataset.


### Dataset Preparation (`dataset.py`)

Prepare and preprocess the dataset for training and testing the model.


### Model Architecture (`model.py`)

Defines the architecture of the 3D U-Net and convolutional LSTM used for defect detection.

## Results

The results of training and evaluation are summarized in `training_results_summary.txt`. This includes metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any other relevant performance indicators.
